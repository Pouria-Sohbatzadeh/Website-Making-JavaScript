// The way to access the individual values of an Array stored in an Array is:
// 1 - by first writing the variable that you've stored the Array in.
// 2 - gluding a bracket|[]|to the right of the variable, Then putting the syntax address of the stored Array in the bracket|[]|.
// 3 - Glueing another bracket|[]| to the first bracket, Then putting the syntax of the value that you want to access inside the bracket|[]|
