// There are two key words that allow us to create variables


// The 1st keyword is const, This keyword allows us to create variables that can't have the values stored in them, Changed.
const my_birthday = "14th of Azar" //My birthday date, Just like in real life, can't be changed.

// my_birthday = "10th of Azar" 
// If I attempt to change the value stored in a const variable (As I tried with the above code), It will give me an error about how I made a mistake in 
//trying to change the value, Uncomment line 7 to see for yourself.
console.log(my_birthday) 

// 

// The 2nd keyword is let, Which allows me to create variables that can have the values stored in them changed
let age = 20 // My age will NEVER stay the same!

age = 25// We only use the let keyword to create brand new variables, After that we don't need to use the let keyword again to change the value stored in the variable
console.log(age)
