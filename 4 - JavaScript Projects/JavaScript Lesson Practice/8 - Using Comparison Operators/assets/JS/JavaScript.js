// Comparison Operators, Operators that will ONLY result in a boolean value
// They include

// = : Allows us to store values inside of variables

// > : Determines wheter a value or a stored value is greater than another or not
console.log(10 > 20)// 10 is not greater than 20, Thus the resulting value wil be false

// < : Determines wheter a value or a stored value is smaller than another or not
console.log(10 < 20)// 10 is smaller than 20, Thus the resulting value wil be true


// >= : Determines wheter a value or a stored value is greater or equal to another or not
console.log(30 >= 14)// 30 is greater than 14, Thus the resulting value wil be true

console.log(30 >= 30)// 30 isn't greater than 30, But it's equal, Thus the resulting value wil be true


// <= : Determines wheter a value or a stored value is greater or equal to another or not
console.log(2 <= 10)// 2 is smaller than 10, Thus the resulting value wil be true

console.log(10 <= 10)// 10 isn't greater than 10, But it's equal, Thus the resulting value wil be true
