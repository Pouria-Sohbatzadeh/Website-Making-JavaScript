// By putting our values, variables, operators and function inside back dits ``, We can write them in the same line without need for + operator!
// We put the values in the back dits |``| normally
// We put the variables, operators and functions inside a curled brace {} and THEN glue a dollar sign $ of the left of the curled brace

// With this method, Our writing becomes no different than normal, Distancing our variables, operators and functions fro meach other a simple space rather than tediously 
// having to add a space value between them like in +, And you can write MULTIPLE data types in the same line

// Everthing will be considerd a strin though, So be wary of that
